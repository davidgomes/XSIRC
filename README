XSIRC is a GTK+-based IRC client. It is lightweight and very simple to use.

Installing
==========

XSIRC depends on GTK+ 3, libnotify 0.7 and libgee. It also requires Python
and Vala 0.16 for the compilation. Installation is simple:

  ~/xsirc $ ./waf configure
  ~/xsirc $ ./waf build
  ~/xsirc $ ./waf install
 
XSIRC can be uninstalled by calling ./waf uninstall.

Contributing
============

XSIRC still has quite some features left to be added; please contribute if
you can. Suggestions, criticisms, and code are all accepted.
